# key
Welcome to key, the programming language.

## What is key?
key is a programming language created on June 17, 2020. It was abandoned later that year due to boredom and other projects.
It was later revived on July 24, 2021.

## What happened to it?
Since key has been abandoned, I've focused on other projects and learning other topics.
Recently, I've been reviving another dead language, stupid. I really don't like the name and I think it might be better as key.
