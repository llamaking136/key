# key
I'm making a programming language. I'ts called 'Key'.

## NOTE! key IS BEING UPDATED! PLEASE CHECK OUT BRANCH `new` INSTEAD OF THIS ONE!

Basically, I wanted a programming language like Python, but the compilabillity of C++.
I tried compiling Python code, but it's just some kind of encryption, and it still requires the modules there.

So I said, "Hey! What if I created my own programming language?"

The compiler works by reading the inputted file, writing to a C++ file, compiling the C++ file, and there you go!

Hope this goes farther than I excpect.
